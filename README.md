# DeathRoll
# How is it played
At the start of the game you are given a random amount of coins. You are then asked how much you would like to bet. The game then rolls for your and the computer. If you win your bet is doubled, if you lose your bet is lost. You can either play down to zero, or after each match you are given a chance to leave
