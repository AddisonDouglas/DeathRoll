# DeathRoll
# What is this?
Deathroll is a betting dice game orgianlly coming from the MMO World of Warcraft. Two players would bet a certain amount of gold, player 1 would then roll from 0 to the bet, then player 2 would roll from 0 to whatever player 1 rolled. Whoever hits zero first loses. This is my verson of that.
# How is it played?
At the start of the game you are given a random amount of coins. You are then asked how much you would like to bet. The game then rolls for your and the computer. If you win your bet is doubled, if you lose your bet is lost. You can either play down to zero, or after each match you are given a chance to leave
